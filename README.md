# Assessment: JavaScript Katas 1 #

### Overview ###

A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) is an individual exercise where you practice a programming skill through repetition. Today you will practice using JavaScript loops, conditionals, and expressions through a series of katas.

You will create a single webpage with an embedded script for all these exercises, and use `console.log()` for all output.

Begin each kata with a `console.log()` statement printing the kata's description. Use a `for` or `while` loop for each kata. Use `console.log()` to display each number. Each correctly completed kata is worth 1 point.

### Example ###

```js
console.log("Display the numbers from 1 to 5.");  
for (let counter = 1; counter <= 5; counter++) {
   console.log(counter);
}
```

### Katas ###

1.  Display the numbers from 1 to 20. _(1, 2, 3, ...,19, 20)_
2.  Display the even numbers from 1 to 20. _(2, 4, 6, ..., 18, 20)_
3.  Display the odd numbers from 1 to 20. _(1, 3, 5, ..., 17, 19)_
4.  Display the multiples of 5 up to 100. _(5, 10, 15, ..., 95, 100)_
5.  Display the [square numbers](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number) up to 100. _(1, 4, 9, ..., 81, 100)_
6.  Display the numbers counting backwards from 20 to 1. _(20, 19, 18, ..., 2, 1)_
7.  Display the even numbers counting backwards from 20. _(20, 18, 16, ..., 4, 2)_
8.  Display the odd numbers from 20 to 1, counting backwards. _(19, 17, 15, ..., 3, 1)_
9.  Display the multiples of 5, counting down from 100. _(100, 95, 90, ..., 10, 5)_
10.  Display the square numbers, counting down from 100. _(100, 81, 64, ..., 4, 1)_
